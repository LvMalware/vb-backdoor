Another software from the old days of the (r)Windows.

This one is a kind of backdoor (again, only for study), written in VB.Net.

It listens on the TCP port 6513 and after login, you get access to a shell (the Windows Command Prompt, actually).

(NOTE: don't use for any illegal purposes. I won't be reponsible for any damage caused to anybody)
